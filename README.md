# Nurse-Tech-Journey 🏥 ➡️ 💻
I am a registered nurse eagerly seeking to transition into tech. After many of months of considering which sector in tech I have narrowed it down to DevOps, Cloud, and Cybersecurity. Let's see where I end up. 🤞

**Starting off with the basics....My Introduction into Tech**
* I've been a registered nurse for seven years now. I understand that if I want to transition into technology I will need to tackle the basics at the most elementary level, therefore, I am currently learning CompTIA A+. I am opting out in taking the certification, I am just studying as if I am. 
My resources are the following: Professor Messer CompTIA A+ 220-1101 and 220-1102 playlists on Youtube. In conjucntin with exam objectives to read along with CompTIA A+ Certification Exam Guide, 11th ed.
